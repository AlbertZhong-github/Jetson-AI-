    "##### **Main Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Shot Detection: SSD belongs to the Single Shot detection algorithms, unlike Two-Stage algorithms (such as Faster R-CNN), which do not require generating candidate regions before classification and regression. Instead, SSD directly predicts the locations and categories of objects on feature maps of multiple scales.<br>\n",
    "Multi-scale Detection: The SSD algorithm uses feature maps of different scales to detect objects of varying sizes. On lower-level feature maps with smaller receptive fields, it is suitable for detecting small objects, while on higher-level feature maps with larger receptive fields, it is suitable for detecting large objects. This multi-scale detection approach enables SSD to simultaneously detect both large and small objects.<br>\n",
    "Prior Boxes: SSD borrows the Anchor mechanism from Faster R-CNN and introduces the concept of Prior Boxes. Prior Boxes are a predefined set of rectangular boxes, whose scales and aspect ratios can be adjusted according to specific tasks. During the detection process, SSD generates multiple Prior Boxes at each location on each feature map and predicts the offsets and class probabilities of these Prior Boxes through the network.<br>\n",
    "Feature Pyramid: SSD adopts a detection approach based on a feature pyramid, where predictions are made on feature maps of different scales. This approach enables SSD to more fully utilize multi-scale information in the image, improving the accuracy and robustness of detection.<br>\n",
    "##### **Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "**Feature Extraction:** Use a pre-trained base network (MobileNet V2) to extract features from the input image, obtaining feature maps of different scales.<br>\n",
    "**Prior Box Generation:** Generate multiple Prior Boxes at each location on each feature map. The scales and aspect ratios of the Prior Boxes can be adjusted according to specific tasks.<br>\n",
    "Location Offset and Class Prediction: Predict the location offsets and class probabilities of the Prior Boxes through the network. The location offsets are used to adjust the position and size of the Prior Boxes, making them more accurately cover the objects. The class probabilities are used to determine whether a Prior Box contains an object and the category of the object.<br>\n",
    "Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS): Merge the prediction results from different feature maps and use the Non-Maximum Suppression algorithm to remove redundant prediction boxes, obtaining the final detection results.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MobileNet V2** provides a lightweight feature extractor with a convolutional structure of around 53 layers.<br>\n",
    "- **SSD** adds an additional 6 layers of detection layers on top of it, which are used to generate object class predictions and bounding box regressions.<br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "The total number of convolutional layers in the SSD MobileNet V2 COCO model is approximately 59 layers. This number does not include potential activation layers, batch normalization layers, etc. If these layers are included, the actual number of computational layers would be even higher.<br>\n",
